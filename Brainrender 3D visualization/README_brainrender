Uses Python 3.7.8

Individual Python files render the cells and CN differently, either showing each cell with a different color based on connectivity pattern, or showing cells in greyscale to representing ascending number of connected zones (lighter to darker).

The .csv file is required to identify cells, their coordinates, and their connectivity patterns.

This code is not fully compatible with Jupyter Notebook environments. We used Visual Studio Code to facilitate rendering.
